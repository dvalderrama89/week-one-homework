# Description
This repository contains the refactored version of the starter code for week 1 homework. The refactor consisted of alterations to the HTML elements to swap over as many to semantic elements as possible, and CSS consolidation to reduce the number of CSS classes in use. Also, the navigation links were checked for consistency and the website name was updated.
